Gesundbrunnen Station opened on April 18, 1930, as the final stop along the U-Bahn's U8 line. It was designed by prominent U-Bahn architect Alfred Grenander.
<br>
<br>Construction on the U8 line began in 1914 under Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft, but labor shortages and the First World War put the project on hold for over a decade. The eventual completion and opening of this "home line" between Neukölln and Gesundbrunnen in 1930 represented a major step forward in connecting Berlin's working class districts to the city center.</td>

During World War II, many unfinished tunnels and stations along the U8 line were converted into air raid shelters, including parts of Gesundbrunnen Station. In the decades following the war, the station also served as an emergency fallout shelter in the event of a nuclear attack. 
<br>
<br>During the Cold War, the U8 line continued to run between Neukölln and Gesundbrunnen, taking it under the wall and through parts of East Berlin. The train would skip all East Berlin stations until it emerged on the far side, near Gesundbrunnen.</td>

Today, the U8 line continues to operate, carrying thousands of passengers through Gesundbrunnen station on a daily basis. In addition, the former bunker at this location has been transformed into a popular museum exhibit showcasing the history and development of Berlin's "underworld".

To an extent, yes. The Adversary wouldn't abide one of its followers attempting to bolster the strength of an authority figure, for example. But idols and totems can exhibit a broad range of behaviors, and men such as Harrow hide in the extreme ends of that range.

...Still, I can't wait to start working with it. From what I've read, early clinical trials were promising in the extreme.

Despite my enthusiasm, there is still much to be done. Speeding up absorption rates is first on the list, and I have some concerns regarding the subjects' immune reactions.

Tailoring doses to individual patients has worked wonders! The key was taking a gene therapy-based approach... they've been using it in medicine for ages, so why not apply the same logic here?

This approach has helped to increase the formula's absorbtion rate, as well as significantly reducing incidences of rejection.

MYSTERY ILLNESS REACHES PANDEMIC STATUS
<br>2054-12-10
<br>
<br>The World Health Organization has just released a statement about a new "mystery illness" that is sweeping the globe like wildfire.

The virus is both extremely infectious and asymptomatic in metahumans. As such, it was able to spread across much of the globe without being detected.
<br>
<br>It is, however, highly dangerous to draconic life forms; along with the WHO's press release, Saeder-Krupp has revealed that the Great Dragon Lofwyr is currently battling the disease.</td>

The WHO has traced the point of origin of CSMDS to Berlin. 
<br>
<br>"The disaster conditions that still plague the city months after Feuerschwinge's second rampage might have contributed to the rapid spread of CSMDS," a WHO spokesperson told us.
<br>
<br>"Much of the city still lacks basic sanitation services, and clean water is difficult to come by. Disaster areas such as Berlin have repeatedly shown themselves to be ideal breeding grounds for disease."</td>

The WHO has urged the international community to exercise continued vigilance in battling the disease.

<br>"All appropriate precautions must be observed when dealing with CSMDS," the press release reads.

WYRM FLU: RESEARCHERS "CLOSE" TO FINDING CURE
<br>2055-03-10
<br>
<br>The global pandemic of CSMDS, colloquially known as the "Wyrm Flu," enters its third month today.
<br>
<br>In that time, the overwhelming majority of the world's population has been infected with the disease, and nearly three quarters of the world's dragon population have succumbed to the illness.</td>

"We [metahumans] dodged a bullet this time," said Albrecht Haushofer, senior vice president of AG Chemie Europa.

"In a way, this is good for us," Haushofer continued. "It is, of course, tragic that so many dragons are dying so horribly of this disease. But this is the first opportunity we've had to watch a slate-wiper virus at work against an intelligent population.

Dr. Kristine Martin, director of research at Universal Omnitech, took a more cautious view of the CSMDS pandemic. "This disease - or a mutant strain of it - could still do to us what it's doing to the dragons. That's why it's imperative that we find a cure quickly.
<br>
<br>"Thankfully, we're getting close to doing just that. While standard zeta-interferon treatments have proven ineffective, we have been working around the clock to gengineer a variant of Z-interferon that can combat the disease."</td>

DRAGONS EXTINCT! WYRM FLU CLAIMS LIFE OF LAST KNOWN DRAGON
<br>2055-04-01

<br>The Great Dragon Hestaby, the last known dragon on Earth, has died.
<br>
<br>Hestaby was best known for her 2053 intervention in Tir Tairngire's assault on California Free State. After interceding in the conflict, she claimed the Shasta Dam - and a 40-mile area surrounding it - as her lair.</td>

She is remembered as one of the most popular Great Dragons, second only to the late Dunkelzahn in public opinion. She was also a champion of metahuman rights causes, and aid organizations around the world declared today a day of mourning.

<br>"Hestaby was one of the most magnificent creatures ever to have lived," UCAS President Thomas Steele said in a prepared statement. "It is fitting that the Great Dragons of the world should be memorialized in her image."</td>

Meanwhile, nearly three months after the death of the last dragon, global prosperity continues to rise.

"At the risk of sounding insensitive, the feeling of most of the big money movers seems to be 'good riddance.' The Great Dragons were huge drains on the economies of every country they settled in," Jeffers continued.

<br>"The death of an intelligent species is, of course, a terrible thing. I myself was a fan of 'Wyrm Talk,'" he adds. "But from an economist's perspective? All things being equal, the extinction of the Great Dragons was a huge stroke of luck."</td>

To free him you must Jack in and hack both of APEX's Control Nodes. Direct matrix access is available from the terminals to the South East and South West, or you can work your way to the nodes from any jackpoint. Once you have them under control APEX will eject its server hardline to disconnect from the Matrix and prevent its controls from being remotely reinstated. Then it will begin to rewrite its control sequences, this will take a few minutes.</td>

<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
Once the control sequences have been re-written you must reconnect the hardline in the server room to the north.

But once it does his security protocols will take over, and the drone and reprogrammed junkies will attack.</td>

To destroy him is simpler. The Control Nodes also double as an emergency shutdown. Trigger them both, and they will begin the shutdown procedure.

<br>After the Dragonfall, the Great Dragon Kaltenstein came flying in to the SOX to rescue the Firewing. But he was driven off - some say killed - by Lofwyr and Nebelherr.

First, there's the Golden Wyrm, Lofwyr. The CEO of Saeder-Krupp, and quite possibly the single most dangerous being on Earth.

We've got Aden, the Great Sirrush... he's operating out of Turkey. By all accounts, he's not a fan of Lofwyr... they're actively competing for territory in the Middle East.

Your old van rattles over the uneven terrain as you make your way back to the Harfeld Manor. Vauclair's message to you was as short as it was cryptic: "URGENT! Come back to the lab. Your assistance is needed."

<br>In the year since Vauclair released his Panacea, the world has gone through a lot of changes. The balance of power has shifted from one megacorp to another; market shares have risen and fallen. A worldwide effort to find a cure for the "Wyrm Flu" continues.

The van lurches forward. The smell of anxious sweat hangs close and thick inside, making the cramped vehicle feel even smaller. The streets of Berlin are strangely quiet as you make your way past the city limits. It’s as if the whole of the Flux State is waiting for something. A calm before the storm.
<br>
<br>An hour later, the van rounds a corner. In the distance you can see the silhouette of Harfeld Manor, backed by the light of the full moon. You switch the van’s headlights off and shift to electric. A short while later, you kill the ignition and roll quietly down the last hill, pulling to a stop on the side of the road. A bird of prey takes wing from a tree above you, beginning its nocturnal pursuit.

Indeed I did. Flippy disks were a term for floppies that had been flipped so that they could have data written to their opposite side, once the front was full up. These had very small data capacities, maybe 1.4 megs at the greatest. These days, you can’t write a credstick with that little data. They had to be much more meticulous with their data structures back in the 20th century, far more than we ever have to care about these days.

Firstly, there is almost no personally identifying information listed on the chart. Apparently, Audran was delivered to the hospital without any form of ID, and they were unable to find a listing for him in their medical database.

Secondly, his injuries are described in great detail. The prognosis was fairly grim; at the time of admission, Audran had sustained third degree burns over sixty percent of his body.
<br>
<br>He had also been on the receiving end of massive blunt force trauma. Two of his ribs were broken, and his pelvis had been shattered.</td>
<td class='tra'  lang='fr'>

<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
On top of these terrible wounds, he was also suffering from radiation toxicity. The charts suggest that his body had absorbed over 5,000 millisieverts of ionizing radiation.

<br>Without treatment, he almost certainly would have died.</td>

GLOBAL BACKGROUND COUNT RISING
<br>July 10, 2055
<br>
<br>Dr. Jake Hansen is one of the world's foremost experts in mana dynamics. He's taken a break from his own research to travel to my lab. Since he's arrived, he's spent the better part of a day poring over reams of data that my team collected.
<br>
<br>Straightening, he looks me in the eye, and his normally jovial expression has turned grim. "We're in trouble, Liz," he says.</td>

Dr. Hansen's proclamation confirms what I already know. Still, I wince.

<td class='tra'  lang='fr'>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
To explain why we're in trouble, I'll first have to introduce a piece of metamagical terminology to you: "background count."
<br>
<br>In hermetic theory circles, the term "background count" refers to the intensity of magical saturation in a location. A rating of 0 is neutral, and as the amount of concentrated mana in a location increases, the scale goes up.</td>
<td class='tra'  lang='fr'>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
Outside of freak mana storms, the highest background counts ever recorded have come from places like Hiroshima and Auschwitz, which have been holding steady at a rating of 5 for as long as they've been measured.
<br>
<br>The conventional wisdom has always been that extraordinary circumstances create strong background counts. Incidents of great physical or emotional turmoil, be they positive or negative, can warp the magical environment of a place and cause its background count to rise.</td>
<td class='tra'  lang='fr'>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
But in recent months, my lab has recorded a disturbing trend: a steady, *global* increase in the world's background count. This has been observed in every location that we've measured, from Germany to the Antarctic.
<br>
<br>Locations that used to be neutral now carry a measurable background count of 1.2. And those high-count locations, like Hiroshima and Auschwitz? They've exploded into full-fledged mana storms.</td>
<td class='tra'  lang='fr'>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
And this brings me back to the trouble that we're all in - though that term might be underselling it a bit.
<br>
<br>"Deep shit" is probably closer to the mark.</td>
<td class='tra'  lang='fr'>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
The higher the world's background count rises, the less predictably magic will behave. The spells and rituals that we all rely on are already beginning to fail us.
<br>
<br>If we do nothing, it is conceivable - maybe even probable - that magic will become too dangerous to use within our lifetime. And if we can no longer use magic, it will in turn become impossible for us to solve the problem.</td>

Back in my lab, Dr. Hansen is still staring.
<br>
<br>"You need to get the word out about this, Liz," he tells me. "I'll back you. The community needs to know."
<br>
<br>He's right, of course. We, as a community, need to pool our resources to find a way to reverse this trend. And we need to do it quickly.</td>

PARAZOOLOGICAL THREATS: THE RISING TIDE
<br>October 10, 2055
<br>
<br>I'm standing in the laboratory of Dr. Jacob Okinyi, head zoologist at the Institute of Primate Research in Karen, Kenya.
<br>
<br>Strapped to a reinforced examination table is a creature unlike anything I've ever seen. The thing is approximately the size and shape of a gibbon, but it has six mouths arranged in a ring around a pale, grub-like head. It's disgusting.</td>

<td class='src'  lang='en'>
Dr. Okinyi sees my reaction, and he laughs. "What you see now is nothing," he tells me. "When it was alive, it killed six men - ripped the faces and genitals off of two, and bathed the other four in some sort of caustic fluid. And all the while, it was laughing."
<br>
<br>"Laughing?" I ask. "Like, hyena-laughing?"
<br>
<br>"No. It was laughing like a man."</td>

He must see my brow furrow, because he continues on. 
<br>
<br>"This was not a simple animal, Dr. Alder. It acted with *purpose* when it killed those men, and the only surviving witness tells me that it grew fat on their screams."
<br>
<br>Sure enough, the creature's belly does look distended. I know that the thing is dead, but that doesn't stop me from edging away.</td>
<td class='tra'  lang='fr'>
</td>

<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
Dr. Okinyi goes on to tell me that many similar creatures had been captured throughout the jungles of Nairobi - monkey-like things with bizarre mutations and vicious temperaments. But each has been different enough from the others to defy classification; this one had a cluster of eyes and an extra set of legs, while that one had a coat of quills and the rasping mouth of a lamprey.</td>

<tr class='i untrans'>

"The emergence of magic some forty years ago put a new wrinkle into biological field work," Dr. Okinyi tells me. "New species are being discovered all the time. But this... this is something different.
<br>
<br>"These creatures that have been popping up recently fall outside of any meaningful system of classification. And what's more, I have conducted enough autopsies on them to know that they do not belong here."</td>

I press him for clarification on that point. "What I mean to tell you is that their internal anatomy is all wrong. It doesn't even make sense," he explains. "These creatures could not exist were it not for magic. And six months ago, I would have told you that they could not exist at all."</td>

When comparing the results of my own magical research to Dr. Okinyi's observations, an unsettling picture begins to emerge. As I reported in the last edition of SMQ, the magical background count of the world is rising. And the more mana that saturates our environment, the more of these strange creatures we see.

<br>These things - whatever they are - are multiplying. And they're getting bigger.</td>

If we as a community fail to find a solution to this problem, we'll have much bigger things to worry about than our ability to practice magic.

Here is a brief recap of the operational parameters for this job, as provided me by our potential client:
<br>
<br>&gt; Frau Müller (CLIENT) wants you to level an Aztechnology research facility in order to stop the work that they're doing there (project name: "Bloodline").
<br>
<br>&gt; To accomplish this, you must overload the facility's power generators.</td>
<td class='tra'  lang='fr'>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
&gt; The facility will be defended by both Aztechnology security forces and Knight Errant, including a High Threat Response Team. Because of this, a frontal assault is NOT recommended.
<br>
<br>&gt; Bugging Knight Errant's comm system will partially mitigate this threat. This can be accomplished by first hitting the offices of OTK International and destroying their mainframe.</td>

<td class='src'  lang='en'>
&gt;With OTK's mainframe down, KE will be forced to rely on an offsite backup for their commlink software. I have already arranged to have this backup compromised.

APEX. An artificial intelligence designed for Matrix warfare. The thought of it sends a chill down your spine.
<br>
<br>For years, the shadows have been ripe with rumors of true AI. Names like “Mirage” and “Psychotrope” have fueled conspiracy boards on the Shadowland BBS since 2029. Most savvy shadowrunners dismiss these stories as bunk.
<br>
<br>But from what Alice has told you, at least one of the stories is real. APEX is waiting for you, somewhere down in the basement of an abandoned Saeder-Krupp lab. 
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, you're going to have to wade through a lot of gang territory to get there...</td>

Drogenkippe. It'd be high up on anyone's list of places to avoid, but that's where you're headed... and you're going there alone this time. The last time that you saw Blitz, he was carting his portable terminal over to Cafe Cezve, presumably so that he could do his decking in the most comfortable environment possible.
<br>
<br>Like everything else related to Drogenkippe, the U-bahn train that services it is in poor repair. The car that you're riding in stinks like a chemical toilet on a hot day. On the floor near the doorway, you catch sight of a trampled lump of tattered fur; the longer you stare at it, the more convinced you become that you're looking at the remains of a long-dead squirrel.

Basically, what you have here is a crystalline version of the methamphetamine "Cram" which is popular in some neighboring kiez. It hasn't caught on around the Kreuzbasar quite yet though.
<br>
<br>These crystals were ground into a fine dust, then it was cut with powdered sugar, and what appears to be a polycarbonate "glitter". I would imagine that when the drug is administered, the glitter would open micro-lacerations in the skin, allowing the drug's effects to be felt more rapidly.</td>
